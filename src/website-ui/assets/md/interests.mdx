## Golf
Golf is a great sport and while frustrating at times, you will find everyone at the course is still pretty happy to be up there. I worked at the Castlegar Golf Club for several years and really enjoy the people and culture. I played a lot of golf when I was younger. I would spend every day in the summer up at the course. Golf is also pretty affordable for junior members.

## Fitness
One of the most addictive parts of a workout is the feeling afterwards.

## Cross Country Skiing
This is a new activity for me, and a nice way to spend time outside.

## Hockey
There is something great about being on the ice and hockey has a special place in my heart. When I was younger, I trained pretty hard because I was so obsessed with the sport. These days I like to play with a local drop in team.

I also referee hockey part-time in the winter. The reason I referee is that I like the sport. I think a lot of people have the wrong idea about referees, most are just hockey fans and want to be involved in the game. Understandably during a hockey game both teams and referees have different objectives so there is some conflict. Refereeing is quite challenging.
