## Motorcycle
During high school, I spent a lot of time in the mechanics and woodworking shop. I was lucky to have many great instructors who supported challenging projects. Working on these projects was a blast. During these projects, I learned how to use the lathe, several welding techniques, and bending tools.

## Golf Putters
I took a Millwright / Machinist apprentice course at Selkirk College, and during the program, I had some extra time to build these golf putters. The models were first designed using 3D CAD software then machined into the final product. The finished putters are parkerized to help prevent rust. The finish is porous and needs treatment with oil for the anti-rust property.

## 3D Printer
I took a mini-workshop at Selkirk College, and the objective was to assemble a pre-designed 3D printer. After the printer was complete, I made a few things. The first step with making something using a 3D printer is to build a 3D software model. Then you need to run the model through another program which slices the model layer by layer into a code the 3D printer understands. Sometimes you need to design several components because a single design will not print very well.

## My Website

I enjoy web development and design. I believe the developer tools are the best around, and you can prototype things very quickly.

Some technology this site uses:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

All of these technologies are free to use.
