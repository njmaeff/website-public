I really enjoy working with my hands and building things. I hope to build a nice shop one day.

## Motorcycle
During high school I spent a lot of time in the mechanics and woodworking shop. I was lucky to have many great instructors who supported challenging projects. Working on these projects was a blast. With my experience, I learned how to use the lathe, several welding techniques, and bending tools.

## Golf Putters
I took a Millwright / Machining apprentice course at Selkirk College and during the program I had some extra time to build these golf putters. The models were first designed using 3D CAD software then machined into to the final product. The golf putters have a parkerized finish to help prevent rust. The finish is porous and needs to be treated with oil for the anti rust property.

## 3D Printer
I took a mini workshop at Selkirk College, and the objective was to assemble a pre-designed 3D printer. After the printer was complete I made a few things. The first step with making something using a 3D printer is to build a 3D software model. Then you need to run the model through another program which slices the model layer by layer into a code the 3D printer understands. Sometimes you need to design several components because a single design will not print very well.

## This Website!

I have really taken to web development and design. I believe the developer tools are the best around, and you can prototype things very quickly.

Some technology this site uses:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

All of these technologies are free to use.
